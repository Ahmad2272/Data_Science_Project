Spam Email Classification
This data science project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam. The project utilizes a dataset consisting of labeled spam and non-spam emails, extracting relevant features such as word frequencies, metadata, and email content characteristics.

The objectives of this project include:

Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and preprocess the email data to extract meaningful features.
Feature Extraction: Use techniques like TF-IDF, bag-of-words, or word embeddings to represent emails as numerical features.
Model Development: Train and evaluate various classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to classify emails as spam or non-spam.
Performance Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model to classify new, unseen emails and provide predictions in real-time.
